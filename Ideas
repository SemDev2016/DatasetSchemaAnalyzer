Get all classes:

SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {
  ?y rdf:type ?x
}

Get superclass for each class:

SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {
  ?y rdfs:subClassOf ?x
}
# Where y is passed in

For every class, find its parent and connect the subclass to its superclass. Do this until you cannot connect any more classes.

List all properties having the class as subject and count all objects related with that class via the property

Select Distinct ?property (Count(?x) as ?CountX)
Where
	{?LowestLevelClass ?property ?x .}
Group by ?property
